# Crop-Job
Written in C# [.NET Framework 4.7.2]

Crop Job is usefull when we have many images all in the same size (for example multiple screenshots) and we want to cup the same areas in every one of them. With this app you just put the desired parameters one, hit Crop and all the work get's done for you.

-------------

### USEFULL TRICK

if you use the app mostly for screenshots, you can link C:\Users\Admin\Pictures\Screenshots directly, take out previous pictures and the whole proces of taking screenshots and croping them will be faster
